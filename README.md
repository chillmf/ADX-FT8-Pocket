The project consists of a single PCB which plugs directly into a STM32F746 Disco Board using the built in Arduino Connectors on the 746 Board and a single mono audio connection. The project board includes  Si4732 Receiver, Si5351 Clock,  BS170 FET Power Amplifier, Battery Management / Charger Board, 5 Volt Operation.

The power output is 500 mWatt and the receive Minimum Descernible Signal (MDS) is better than -120 dBm

The board is based on the ADX Transceivers which Barb has design. This series of transceivers uses plug in Band Pass filters.
This project provides signal generation and reception for the 80, 40, 30, 20, 17, and 15 meter bands.
